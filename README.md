**Ph.D.** Dissertation: Advanced Polynomial Matrix Factorization Mathod\\
Abstract: My PhD work focused on developing polynomial matrix factorization techniques essential
for addressing challenges in broadband MIMO systems. These techniques found widespread
application in MIMO decoding, speech enhancement, data compression, fetal ECG
extraction, speaker separation, and broadband beamforming. The project had a dual focus:
optimizing existing polynomial algorithms for reduced computational complexity and
introducing new, highly parallelizable algorithms showcasing superior performance
compared to current solutions.\\
